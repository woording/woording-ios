woording-ios
============

##How to use
You'll need CocoaPods, which you can install using `sudo gem install cocoapods`.  
After that, you'll need to `cd` into this project and run `pod` install:
```bash
cd woording-ios
pod install
open wording.xcworkspace
```
NOTE: Do not open wording.xcodeproj, Xcode won't load cocoapods if you open it that way
